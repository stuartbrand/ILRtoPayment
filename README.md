# Educational ILR Data Processing and Payment File Generation

Welcome to the README page for the **Educational ILR Data Processing and Payment File Generation** project. This open-source software platform aims to provide a solution for processing educational Individualised Learner Record (ILR) data and generating payment files. This document will guide you through the essential information about the project, including its purpose, features, installation instructions, and how you can contribute.

## Introduction

The Educational ILR Data Processing and Payment File Generation project is developed in Java to streamline the handling of educational ILR data and automate the creation of payment files. In collaboration with the West Midlands Combined Authority and Amazon Web Services and their Solutions Incubator Team, this software platform aims to simplify the process of managing and processing student-related information for educational institutions, such as colleges and training providers.

By leveraging the power of this open-source software, Local Authorities can efficiently process ILR data and generate payment files, enabling them to meet compliance requirements, facilitate accurate reporting, and simplify financial transactions with relevant funding bodies.

## Features

- **ILR Data Processing**: The software platform provides robust functionality to import, validate, and process ILR data, ensuring its accuracy and integrity.

- **Payment File Generation**: Generate payment files based on the processed ILR data, complying with the relevant file format standards and specifications.

- **Flexible Configuration**: Customize and configure the software according to specific institutional requirements, allowing for seamless integration into existing workflows.

- **Reporting and Analytics**: Gain insights into ILR data through built-in reporting and analytics features, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

- **Audit Trails and Error Handling**: Track and record all data processing activities, including error handling and logging, for comprehensive auditing and troubleshooting purposes.

- **Open Source**: The project is open-source, enabling the community to contribute, improve, and extend its functionality.

## Project Overview

This project aims to replace an existing application with an AWS-based solution for processing ILR educational data. The goal is to demonstrate the end-to-end process and the replacement of each system component. The existing system uses SQL scripts to process data and generates a CSV payment file from the enrollments.

### System Components

The system consists of the following components, the bullet points are what could be done in this project to replace them:

1. **CSV Input File (Occupancy Report):**
   - The occupancy report, in CSV format, serves as the input file for data processing.
   - Store this file in an Amazon S3 bucket to facilitate data ingestion and processing.

2. **Data Ingestion and Error Checking:**
   - Set up an AWS Lambda function triggered by new file uploads to the S3 bucket.
   - This Lambda function will handle error checking and data insertion.
   - Utilize the AWS SDK libraries to parse the CSV file, validate its contents, and perform error checks.
   - Log or notify relevant parties about any identified errors.
   - Insert the validated data into an Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora database table.

3. **Data Normalization:**
   - Create an AWS Glue job or an AWS Lambda function responsible for normalizing the data in the import table.
   - Apply the necessary transformations to ensure the data is in the desired format for further processing.

4. **Enrollment Identification and Contract Matching:**
   - Process each row of the normalized data using AWS Glue, AWS Lambda, or a combination of both.
   - Retrieve contract information from another table using AWS Glue's data catalog or by directly querying the table from the Lambda function.
   - Match each enrollment row with the appropriate contract based on predefined rules.

5. **Payment Determination:**
   - Query the rules table in your database using AWS Glue or Lambda to determine if each enrollment should be paid.
   - Apply the rules and update the data accordingly, marking enrollments as paid or unpaid.

6. **Output Generation:**
   - Utilize AWS Glue or a Lambda function to generate the output for the payment file.
   - Write the payment data to a new table in your database, which will be used for payment file generation and reporting.

7. **Payment File Creation and Reporting:**
   - Implement a Lambda function or an AWS Glue job to generate the payment file from the data in the output table.
   - Write the payment file to an appropriate location, such as another S3 bucket or an external system.
   - Integrate with Amazon QuickSight to create reports based on the processed data. QuickSight can connect to your database directly or consume data from a file stored in S3.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Set up an AWS account if you don't have one already.
2. Create an S3 bucket to store the CSV input file and the generated payment file.
3. Configure AWS Lambda functions for data ingestion, error checking, data normalization, enrollment identification, payment determination, and output generation.
4. Set up an Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora database to store the data.
5. Create the necessary tables in the database for import, output, contract rules, and any other required data.
6. Populate the contract rules table with the relevant data.
7. Deploy the code for each Lambda function or Glue job using the AWS Console or the AWS CLI.
8. Test the system by uploading the occupancy report CSV file to the designated S3 bucket.
9. Verify that the data processing and payment file generation occur as expected.
10. Connect Amazon QuickSight to the processed data to create reports and visualizations.

## Security Considerations

Ensure that appropriate security measures are implemented throughout the system, such as:

- Configuring IAM roles and policies to grant the necessary permissions to AWS resources.
- Implementing encryption at rest and in transit for sensitive data.
- Securing access to the AWS services and resources through VPC configurations, security groups, and network ACLs.
- Following AWS security best practices and guidelines to protect against common security threats.

## Scalability and Performance

Consider the scalability and performance requirements of your application:

- Configure AWS resources, such as RDS or Aurora, to handle the expected data volume and processing load.
- Monitor the system's performance using AWS CloudWatch and set up appropriate alarms to ensure it operates within desired thresholds.
- Implement autoscaling mechanisms where applicable to handle fluctuations in processing demands.

## Conclusion

By following the outlined steps and leveraging AWS services, you can gradually replace each part of the existing system with a robust and scalable AWS-based solution.
