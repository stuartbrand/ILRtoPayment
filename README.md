## Introduction

The Educational ILR Data Processing and Payment File Generation project is developed in Java to streamline the handling of educational ILR data and automate the creation of payment files. In collaboration with the West Midlands Combined Authority and Amazon Web Services and their Solutions Incubator Team, this software platform aims to simplify the process of managing and processing student-related information for educational institutions, such as colleges and training providers.

By leveraging the power of this open-source software, Local Authorities can efficiently process ILR data and generate payment files, enabling them to meet compliance requirements, facilitate accurate reporting, and simplify financial transactions with relevant funding bodies.

## Features

- **ILR Data Processing**: The software platform provides robust functionality to import, validate, and process ILR data, ensuring its accuracy and integrity.

- **Payment File Generation**: Generate payment files based on the processed ILR data, complying with the relevant file format standards and specifications.

- **Flexible Configuration**: Customize and configure the software according to specific institutional requirements, allowing for seamless integration into existing workflows.

- **Reporting and Analytics**: Gain insights into ILR data through built-in reporting and analytics features, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

- **Audit Trails and Error Handling**: Track and record all data processing activities, including error handling and logging, for comprehensive auditing and troubleshooting purposes.

- **Open Source**: The project is open-source, enabling the community to contribute, improve, and extend its functionality.
